^ spits out an "AsyncCursor.close was never aawaited" thing

----

I need to write out async with new_connection blocks in tests (maybe my codemod can look
at an environment variable?)


----

assertNumQueries support in an async context....


----

skipUnlessDBFeature etc.... none of this stuff works with async tests. You can tell because test blocks with those labels are never awaited
